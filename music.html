        <p>BTS, an acronym of Bangtan Sonyeondan or “Beyond the Scene,” is a Grammy-nominated South Korean group that has been
           capturing the hearts of millions of fans globally since its debut in June 2013. The members of BTS are RM, Jin, SUGA, 
           J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jung Kook. There are many reasons that makes me love BTS such as their beautiful lyrics, their
           incredible dance, moves, and looks and how they take every opportunity to mention their fans "ARMY" in every award
           they received.</p>

        <p>Insomniacks is a Malaysian pop band from Kuala Lumpur. Consist of 3 active members which are Iqie, Iskandar and Daniel.
           The reason I like their songs is because the lyrics is so sweet and they have a very good music. My favourite songs from
           Imsomniacks are 'Igauan Malam' and 'Pulang'.
